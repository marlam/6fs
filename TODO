Implement support for extended attributes:
- All extended attributes must fit into one data block (4 KiB), like in ext4
- The inode already has an entry for the index of that data block

Implement support for hole punching:
- Implement FUSE functions fallocate and lseek
- Beware: our existing punchHole() function does not care to fill holes
  with zeroes if the system fallocate() fails because we know we don't
  need to read the data again. We want to keep it that way for efficiency.
  We need an additional flag 'zeroPunchedData' or similar so that
  subsequent reads return correct data for the file system user.

Run tests, including xfs-tests if possible, to check correctness.
